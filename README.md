Auto purchase of Covenant Bookmarks and Mystic Medals in Epic Seven Secret Shop.

Prerequisites:
  1. Python
  2. PyCharm or any IDE
  3. OpenCV
  4. Epic Seven on PC running in BlueStacsk
  
Recommendations:
  1. Epic Seven HD pack downloaded
  2. Bluestacks running in 1600x900 resolution
    - tested on this resolution, and because I can't be bothered to make it any better, some values are hardcoded for this resolution, but it might work on other resolutions as well (if you change the X axis the mouse is moving when it finds Bookmark or Medal, or upload higher quality images)
    
Usage:
  1. Download app
  2. Open in IDE of your choice (recommended PyCharm)
  3. Import time, pyautogui, keyboard, sys
  4. Run program
  5. Enjoy :)
  
Disclaimer:
  1. If the program misses some Bookmarks or Medals that sounds like your problem :)
  2. While the programm is running you can not stop it, so while the program is waiting for something to finish, quicky kill it in the IDE or press WIN + D and mess up the image recognition
  3. Your mouse is unusable during the process
